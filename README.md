Project Idea - A site to give reports when we see any crime

So basically this site will have 2 portals, 1 for the users where they can report the incident they see by giving images and other description and the 2nd one for the authorities (for eg police) where these authorities have to login and they will get these reports on their page and they can take the required action accordingly. Our plan is to reduce the crime rate by helping people report incidents where they are unable to involve directly.
#Software-
Here we have created a django project implemented with firebase to ge the real time database. The "main" folder has all the models, views and templates for the website.
You can also see the static folder where we have put the static files needed for the front end part of the website. For the front end we have used html,css and bootstrap
So you can download the codes and then go to the terminal and run the server using "python manage.py runserver" and then open the local host link that you get. 
This project is not complete. We are planning on getting location from the user and then sending it to the authorities so that the authorities that are nearby will only get the reports on their page. Thus helping in a faster action. We can also make it as an app which can increase its usage.
